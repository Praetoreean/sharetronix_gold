Twitter Feed Import

  -------------------------
  To enable the Twitter Feed Import feature you need to go to Settings -> RSS fees and in the text field Feed Url enter the rss feed address from your 
  profile in Twitter (something like http://twitter.com/user_timeline/1231331.rss  or http://twitter.com/friends_timeline/123123231.rss  The system 
  will automatically recognize that this Twitter RSS and all the data coming from it will display in the Twitter tab in Sharetronix.
  
  If you are upgrading your Sharetronix version most probably your users have already included their RSS feeds and Twitter feeds, however the Twitter 
  Feed Import feature in Sharetronix works only with new feeds (feeds that will come after your upgrade). If you want to include older feeds you need 
  to write a dB query to find all feeds that were coming from Twitter before the upgrade and display them in the Twitter filter. Run the following 
  query in your dB:
  
  'UPDATE users_rssfeeds SET is_twitter="1' WHERE feed_url LIKE "http://twitter.com/%"'
